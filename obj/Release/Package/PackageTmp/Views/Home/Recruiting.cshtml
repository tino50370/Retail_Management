                           When you are now a member of our network you have the option to invite people you know to the network. They accept your invitation by following a link to a registration form.
                           You can also talk to people about the network and create an account for them on acceptance. Once they have an account they are ready to shop and recruite others. The system automatically 
                           adds users you create to your network and you can add as many people as you want to your network. These people you add to the network are your level1 partners. The people they add are level2 and the next level is level3.

                            As people shop on the store the system will allocate commision to the shopper's parents up to level3. Commission is calculated for people directly linked to the particular user. The percentage 
                            commission given to the direct parent is more than the level2 parent which is more than the level3 parent. The more your team shops the more you make money. The system is built to make shopping fun and social but most 
                            importantly it is built to increase your buying power and quality of life. The money made on the network can be cashed out and used for other things. As your network grows so will your income and network ranking.
